The project is a continuation of the project WebTest (http://www.fitnesse.info/webtest), since it is no longer maintained and updated.

The first goals is to keep the the bundle up to date with latest version of FitNesse and Selenium.

The second goal is to add new features. In this direction the primary concern will be to update PlainSeleniumTest in order to have full support for Seleniun instructions.
